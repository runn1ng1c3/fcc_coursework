          Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van
          Rossum, and released in 1991.

            Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to
            the English language with influence from mathematics.
          </li>
          <li>
            Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other
            programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
          </li>
          <li>
            Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope;
            such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming
            languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="Python_Syntax">
        <header>Python Syntax</header>

        <p>We start off by studying the syntax of Python.</p>
        <p>
          As explained in previous section, in the code below, we can see that
          to define the scope of the <code>if</code> statement, the
          <code>print</code> statement is indented once to the right. Lastly, we
          can see that Python syntax is very close to English sentences.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        if 10 > 2 and 5 < 15:
          print("Hello World")
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          From the code above, we can see that to print value in the console:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        print("Hello world")
        </code></pre>

        <p>To insert comments in Python:</p>
        <pre><code>
        # This is a comment
        # in Python
        x = 10 # x is of int type

        '''
        This is how you can also put
        multiline comment in Python
        '''
        </code></pre>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>Variables</header>

        <p>
          A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive
          name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
          </li>
          <li>A variable name cannot start with a number</li>
          <li>
            A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and
            underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
          </li>
          <li>
            Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three
            different variables)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Creating variables</h3>
        <p>
          Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created
          the moment you first assign a value to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Variables do not need to be declared with any particular <i>type</i>,
          and can even change type after they have been set.
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <pre><code>
        x = 4       # x is of type int
        x = "Sally" # x is now of type str

        # All legal variables name in Python
        myvar = "John"
        my_var = "John"
        _my_var = "John"
        myVar = "John"
        MYVAR = "John"
        myvar2 = "John"
    </code></pre>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Function_Declaration">
        <header>Function Declaration</header>
        <p>
          A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You
          can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can
          return data as a result.
        </p>
        <h3>Creating a function</h3>
        <p>
          In Python a function is defined using the <code>def</code> keyword:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        def my_function():
          print("this is a function")
        </code></pre>
        <h3>
          Calling a function by passing arguments and getting the return value
          of the function
        </h3>
        <p>
          To call a function, we just need to pass values to the arguments of
          the function that we defined earlier. Then, by using the
          <code>return</code> keyword, we get the return value of the function.
          For example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        def sum_of_three_numbers(a, b, c):
          return a + b + c
        
        my_function(1, 2, 3) # return value of 6
        </code></pre>
